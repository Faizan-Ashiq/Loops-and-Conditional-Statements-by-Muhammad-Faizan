# 🧠 Python Loops & Conditional Statements — By Muhammad Faizan (MF Coder)

Welcome to the **Python Loops & Conditional Statements Repository**, a part of the **MF Coder Python Learning Series**, followed by **5500+ students** across the globe.  
This section focuses on the **core logic-building concepts** of Python — *loops* and *conditions* — the building blocks of automation, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking.

## 📘 What You’ll Learn

This repository will help you master:

- Understanding **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- **Nested Conditions** and proper indentation logic  
- Understanding **Loops** (`for` and `while`)
- **Range Function** and loop control  
- **Break**, **Continue**, and **Pass** statements  
- **Nested Loops**
- Writing **efficient and readable logic-based programs**
- Building **real-world mini projects** using loops and conditions

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to **solve any logical or pattern-based problem** confidently.

## 🧑‍🏫 Teaching Approach

I believe **clarity + practice = mastery**.  
That’s why every concept here is explained with:

- Simple **real-life examples**  
- **Step-by-step problem breakdowns**  
- **Practice-first** learning (code first, theory next)  
- **Quizzes** to test understanding  
- **Solution files** for guidance and logic review  

This approach helps both **beginners and intermediate learners** develop **critical problem-solving and programming logic**.

## ⚡ How to Use This Repository

Follow this simple 4-step path for the best learning experience:

1. **Start** with the Notes in the `handbook` folder.  
2. **Try** the practice questions — begin with Easy, move to Medium, then Hard.  
3. **Test** your understanding with the Quizzes.  
4. **Compare** your answers using the `Solutions/` folder to improve your approach.
